Technology has played a key role in our journey. It helps us manage and reduce food surplus. This approach ensures that food is used effectively. It prevents waste. By using data and technology, we have gained greater control over food surplus. This has allowed us to create a circular food ecosystem.

Our impact extends beyond numbers. It touches lives and changes habits. We have prevented 3114 tonnes of CO2 emissions. Our initiatives have saved $7.1 million. This demonstrates the economic value of reducing food waste.

More importantly, we have supported over 10,000 families. These families benefit from our food rescue operations. We are proud of our achievements. Yet, we remain focused on our mission. We continue to strive for a zero-waste future.

## The Future of D2L.sg
