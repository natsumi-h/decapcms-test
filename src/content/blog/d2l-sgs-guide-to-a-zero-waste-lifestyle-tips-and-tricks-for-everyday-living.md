In Singapore, the push towards sustainability has become more crucial than ever. D2L.sg, a pioneering regenerative business, stands at the forefront of this movement. Founded by Lin QingHui, our team is a vibrant mix of over 300 rescuers and partners. We are united by a passion for sustainability. We aim to minimize waste and foster a sustainable future for all.

## Embracing Zero Food Waste

[Zero food waste](https://d2l.sg/) is not just a goal. It's a journey. In Singapore, the issue is pressing. Every day, tons of food are wasted. This harms both our environment and society. D2L.sg believes in making every bite count. We have saved over 600+ tonnes of food from being wasted. This has saved 441.6M liters of water and prevented 3114 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

## Start Small at Home

Begin your zero-waste journey in your kitchen. Start by planning your meals. This simple step can significantly reduce waste. Also, embrace leftovers. They can be tomorrow's lunch. By doing so, you make the most of your food. You also save money.

## Understand and Support

Learn about the impact of food waste. It's not just about the food. It's about the resources used to produce that food. Support local initiatives like D2L.sg. We partner with businesses and communities. Together, we divert food from waste to worth. Our efforts have benefited over 10,000 families.

## Shopping with a Purpose

Shopping plays a big role in a zero-waste lifestyle. Making mindful choices can lead to significant changes.

## Buy Only What You Need

This might seem obvious, but it's essential. Overbuying leads to waste. Plan your shopping list based on your meal plans. Stick to it. This helps reduce impulse buys that often end up as waste.

## Choose Bulk and Unpackaged Goods

Singapore offers many options for bulk buying. Choose stores that allow you to buy unpackaged goods. Bring your containers. This reduces packaging waste. It also means you can buy exactly the amount you need.

## Reducing Plastic Use

Plastic waste is a big challenge in Singapore. But there are simple ways to tackle it.

## Use Reusable Containers and Bags

Bring your bags and containers when you shop. Say no to single-use plastics. This small change can have a big impact over time. It reduces the plastic that ends up in our landfills and oceans.

## Choose Products with Less Packaging

Opt for products with minimal packaging. Or better yet, no packaging at all. This not only reduces waste. It also often means choosing healthier, less processed foods.

## Joining Community Efforts

Sustainability is a community effort. In Singapore, D2L.sg has created a network of over 300 rescuers. Together, we're making a difference.

## Volunteer and Participate

Get involved with local sustainability initiatives. D2L.sg always welcomes new volunteers. By joining, you become part of a solution. You help create a more sustainable Singapore.

## Share and Educate

Spread the word about zero-waste living. Share your tips and tricks with friends and family. Education is key to change. The more people know, the more they can do to help.

Living a zero-waste lifestyle is about making thoughtful choices. It's about understanding the impact of our actions. At D2L.sg, we are driven by our values of honesty, transparency, and creativity. We are committed to reducing waste and fostering a sustainable future. Join us on this journey. Together, we can make a real impact towards zero waste in Singapore.
