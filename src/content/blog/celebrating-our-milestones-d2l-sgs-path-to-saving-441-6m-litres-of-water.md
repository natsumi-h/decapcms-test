At D2L.sg, our journey towards sustainability has been nothing short of remarkable. Based in the heart of Singapore, our mission has always been clear. We aim to combat food waste and preserve our precious resources. Our founder, Lin QingHui, along with a dedicated team, drives this vision forward. Together, we've embarked on a quest for [zero food waste](https://d2l.sg/).

## The Foundation of D2L.sg

Our story began in January 2021. It was a simple idea fueled by a passion for sustainability. The problem of food waste in Singapore caught our attention. We couldn't stand by and watch. We decided to act. Our goal was to make a tangible impact. We aimed to reduce waste and foster a greener future.

From the outset, our values of honesty, inclusiveness, and creativity have shaped our actions. We've built a community. It includes over 300 rescuers and numerous partners. This community shares our commitment to a sustainable future.

## The Road to Water Savings

Saving 441.6M litres of water was not an overnight feat. It required dedication and innovation. Every bit of surplus food we diverted contributed to this achievement. This is because producing food requires water. Lots of it. By saving food from waste, we save water.

In Singapore, water is precious. Our efforts here are particularly meaningful. We've demonstrated that zero food waste is not just an ideal. It's a practical way to conserve water.

## Leveraging Technology and Partnerships

Technology has been a cornerstone of our strategy. It has enabled us to track and manage food surplus effectively. This approach ensures that surplus food finds the best possible use. It's about creating a loop of food circularity. A loop that benefits everyone.

Our partnerships have amplified our impact. For example, our collaboration with Goodhood.sg expanded our reach. Together, we've created a network that actively fights food waste. This network has saved not just food but also money and resources.

## The Impact Beyond Numbers

The numbers are impressive. But the real success lies in the lives touched and ecosystems preserved. Beyond the 441.6M litres of water saved, there's more. We've diverted over 600+ tonnes of food from waste. We've prevented 3114 tonnes of CO2 emissions. These efforts have saved businesses $7.1 million.

Our impact extends to families across Singapore. Over 10,000 families have benefited from our initiatives. We've shown that sustainability can support communities. It can make life better for many.

## What Lies Ahead

Our journey doesn't stop here. The challenge of sustainability is ever-evolving. We remain committed to our cause. We continue to explore new ways to fight food waste. Our aim is clear. We want to create a zero waste Singapore.

We invite everyone to join us. Whether as a rescuer, partner, or supporter. There's a role for everyone in this mission. Together, we can achieve even greater milestones.

At D2L.sg, we're proud of our journey towards saving 441.6M litres of water. It's a testament to what can be achieved with commitment and collaboration. Our path has been guided by a vision for a sustainable future. A future where food waste is a thing of the past. Let's continue to work towards this future, for Singapore and for our planet.
