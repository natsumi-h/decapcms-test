          Stemming from her “pathological hatred” for food waste, she founded
          D2L.sg back in 2018 by joining the DBS Foundation competition with her
          peers. She believes that "Zero food waste should be second nature to
          all of us if we accord the most basic respect to all human life" and
          “Even if it is not fit for human consumption, there are much higher
          and better uses that it can be diverted to, other than the digester or
          bin”. This allowed D2L.sg to continuously grow over the years, and
          develop various business models for various stakeholders.
