                <p>
                  Targeting/advertising cookies are used to determine what
                  promotional content is more relevant to you and your
                  interests. They help us deliver targeted advertising and limit
                  the number of times you see an ad, enhancing the effectiveness
                  of our marketing campaigns and the quality of the content you
                  see. These cookies may be set by our website (first-party) or
                  by third-party services. Targeting/advertising cookies set by
                  third parties may track you on other websites that use the
                  same third-party service. We use targeting/advertising cookies
                  to deliver relevant promotional content.
